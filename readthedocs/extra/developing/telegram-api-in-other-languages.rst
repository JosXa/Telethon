===============================
Telegram API in Other Languages
===============================


Telethon was made for **Python**, and as far as I know, there is no
*exact* port to other languages. However, there *are* other
implementations made by awesome people (one needs to be awesome to
understand the official Telegram documentation) on several languages
(even more Python too), listed below:

C
*

Possibly the most well-known unofficial open source implementation out
there by `@vysheng <https://github.com/vysheng>`__,
`tgl <https://github.com/vysheng/tgl>`__, and its console client
`telegram-cli <https://github.com/vysheng/tg>`__. Latest development
has been moved to `BitBucket <https://bitbucket.org/vysheng/tdcli>`__.

JavaScript
**********

`@zerobias <https://github.com/zerobias>`__ is working on
`telegram-mtproto <https://github.com/zerobias/telegram-mtproto>`__,
a work-in-progress JavaScript library installable via
`npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__.

Kotlin
******

`Kotlogram <https://github.com/badoualy/kotlogram>`__ is a Telegram
implementation written in Kotlin (the now
`official <https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/>`__
language for
`Android <https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html>`__) by
`@badoualy <https://github.com/badoualy>`__, currently as a betaâ€“
yet working.

PHP
***

A PHP implementation is also available thanks to
`@danog <https://github.com/danog>`__ and his
`MadelineProto <https://github.com/danog/MadelineProto>`__ project, with
a very nice `online
documentation <https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs/>`__ too.

Python
******

A fairly new (as of the end of 2017) Telegram library written from the
ground up in Python by
`@delivrance <https://github.com/delivrance>`__ and his
`Pyrogram <https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram>`__ library! No hard
feelings Dan and good luck dealing with some of your users ;)

Rust
****

Yet another work-in-progress implementation, this time for Rust thanks
to `@JuanPotato <https://github.com/JuanPotato>`__ under the fancy
name of `Vail <https://github.com/JuanPotato/Vail>`__. This one is very
early still, but progress is being made at a steady rate.
